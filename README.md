## Description:
In this laboratory class, you are expected to implement the classical tick-tact-toe
game. Specification for is as follows:

• Display a 3x3 matrix of buttons.

• Each player gets a turns to pick a button which is not selected. If the player selects a
button already selected the system should ignore that selection and let the user select
again until he/she picks a free button.

• The buttons selected by user 1 should be marked with a 1 and that for user 2 is 2.

• User 1 gets the first chance then the user 2 get the chance and so on.

• Based on the pick the game might continue (in which case the other player should get
his/her turn) or end with either a win to the current player or a draw. When the game ends
the results should be displayed in a different window.
